 become a bar mitzvah! On this website, you can learn about what my bar mitzvah will be 
 all about.</b></p>
 <h2>What are your favorite things to do?</h2>
 <p>I love to play soccer, ski, and hang out with my friends.  I also love to watch sports
  on TV.</p>
  <h2>What is your favorite place you’ve traveled and why?</h2>
  <p>Aspen, because I love skiing and it’s a great place.  Every year my family takes a 
  trip during Spring Break so I often get to have my birthday out there.  I like to hike 
  to the top of the Aspen Highlands bowl, which is 12,392 feet high.  The skiing down is 
  awesome with lots of fresh powder.</p>
  <h2>Where have you been overseas that you’ve liked?</h2>
  <p>Paris.  It’s a really cool place and the food is amazing and there is so much to do.
    We walked to the top of the Eiffel Tower, which has a great view of the city. We 
    visited during the World Cup and I stayed up until 2 am watching the US vs Portugal 
    game. I also liked visiting Holland because I enjoy biking and we got to explore by 
    bike.  The people there are so friendly.</p>
    <h2>What is something you’ve done in your life that you are very proud of?</h2>
<p>Volunteering in Kenya and teaching the students there some of the things I know. We 
encourage them to be better students, even though they so little.  I am very proud that we
feed them lunch every school day – otherwise they wouldn’t eat all day. </p>
<p>I am also proud of the wilderness trips I take with Camp Chewonki.  Last summer I 
kayaked 25 miles over the course of 5 days and slept on Maine coastal islands.  I’m proud 
of it because we worked well together as a group even when the weather was terrible.</p>
<h2>What is one hope you have for your future?</h2>
<p>I’d like to get into a good high school.  We haven’t started looking yet, but I’d like
 to be at place that has good academics and a good soccer team, and a place where I can 
 make a lot of friends and have a great time.</p>
 <h2>What is the funniest joke you’ve heard lately?</h2>
 <p>Not one I’m willing to post on a website that my grandparents are going to be looking 
 at.</p>
