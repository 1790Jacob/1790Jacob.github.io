                <p class="lead">Hi! My name is Jacob.</p>
                <h3>What are your favorite things to do?</h3>
                <p>I love to play soccer, ski, and hang out with my friends. I also like to watch sports on TV.</p>
                <h3>What is your favorite place you’ve traveled and why?</h3>
                <p>Aspen, because I love skiing and it’s a great place. Every year my family takes a trip during Spring Break so I often get to have my birthday out there. I like to hike to the top of the Aspen Highlands bowl, which is 12,392 feet high. The skiing down is awesome with lots of fresh powder.</p>
                <h3>Where have you been overseas that you’ve liked?</h3>
                <p>Paris. It’s a really cool place and the food is amazing and there is so much to do. We walked to the top of the Eiffel Tower, which has a great view of the city. We visited during the World Cup and I stayed up until 2 am watching the US vs Portugal game. I also liked visiting Holland because I enjoy biking and we got to explore by bike. The people there are so friendly.</p>
                <h3>What is something you’ve done in your life that you are very proud of?</h3>
                <p>Volunteering in Kenya and teaching the students there some of the things I know. We encourage them to be better students, even though they so little. I am very proud that we feed them lunch every school day – otherwise they wouldn’t eat all day.</p>
                <p>I am also proud of the wilderness trips I take with Camp Chewonki. Last summer I kayaked 25 miles over the course of 5 days and slept on Maine coastal islands. I’m proud of it because we worked well together as a group even when the weather was terrible.</p>
                <h3>What is one hope you have for your future?</h3>
                <p>I’d like to get into a good high school. We haven’t started looking yet, but I’d like to be at place that has good academics and a good soccer team, and a place where I can make a lot of friends and have a great time.</p>
                <h3>What is the funniest joke you’ve heard lately?</h3>
                <p>Not one I’m willing to post on a website that my grandparents are going to be looking at.</p>
